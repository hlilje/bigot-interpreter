# Bigot Interpreter

This will eventually become an interpreter for the non-functional programming
language **Bigot** written in Haskell. The language and name might change at any
given point.

The parser logic is based on the [Parsing](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/002_parsers.html)
chapter of the _Write You a Haskell_ book by Stephen Diehl
([license](https://github.com/sdiehl/write-you-a-haskell/blob/master/LICENSE)).
